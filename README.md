# Elegoo Neptune 2 "CHEP" Cura 4.11 Profiles

For those using Toylerrr's Cura custom profile for the Neptune 2 from here (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4899915) or here (https://github.com/Toylerrr/ELEGOO_Neptune2_Cura). I figured out how to modify the popular [CHEP printer profile settings](https://www.chepclub.com/cura-profiles.html) so you can add them in Cura 4.11. NOTE: I did make some minor changes noted below to the configurations.

To download them:

1. Click the green "Code" button on this page and then click "Download ZIP" to a location on your computer.
1. Extract the fils on your computer
1. Open Cura then and click on the "Preferences" menu and select "Configure Cura"
1. Select the "Profiles" option on the Preferences screen.
1. Click import and select each profile you unzipped to your computer. (Note: you have to do one at a time)

## My modifications

### All profiles

- Changed the naming of the files to aling with Neptune 2
- Set `skirt_line_count` to `2` (1 just did not seem like enough for me to make sure my bed was level.
- removed any settings where supports were enabled by default
